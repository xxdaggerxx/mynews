The block is opposite Our Tampines Hub\u00a0\u2014 Singapore\u0027s largest integrated community and lifestyle complex with retail shops, a public library as well as sporting facilities.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe flat is a 15-minute walk from two MRT stations \u2014 Tampines on the East-West Line and Tampines West on the Downtown Line.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo find out how these sales come about, TODAY spoke to Mr Luqman and other real estate experts on the considerations involved in such transactions.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ENO PRICE LIMIT FOR RESALE FLAT TRANSACTIONS\u003C\/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe property analysts\u00a0said that such sales are possible because HDB does not regulate the prices of flats in the resale market. This means that a minimum or maximum limit\u00a0is not\u00a0placed on a resale flat transaction.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of data analytics at real estate firm Huttons Asia, said that\u00a0the price is arrived at through a \u201cwilling buyer, willing seller\u201d process of negotiation.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough such lower-price transactions do happen,\u00a0Mr Lee said that the S$100,000 sale of the Tampines flat stood out because it was transacted at a price far below that of other flats in the area.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn\u00a0why these sales happen only occasionally in the resale market, Mr Luqman said that there are usually no financial incentives for a seller to transact at such a low price.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESellers who\u00a0had previously taken a housing loan that is financed through their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings would need to\u00a0fork out cash to pay back the money taken from CPF, upon the sale of their property.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CPF Board requires sellers to refund the principal amount of CPF savings they had withdrawn to pay for their property, alongside the interest accrued, once the unit is sold.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, if the seller\u2019s transaction proceeds do not cover this principal amount and the interest accrued on the loan, it could mean that the seller would instead need to use their own cash savings to pay back the money.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would typically disincentivise sellers from letting go of their property at such low prices, since it would be \u201closs-making sale\u201d for them, Mr Luqman said.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though such policies might discourage some property owners from accepting a low selling price, it does not stop anyone from listing a property at any price and a buyer from purchasing at said prices, he added.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ESEVERAL REASONS WHY SELLERS WANT TO SELL AT LOW PRICES\u003C\/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe experts said that the Tampines unit could have been sold at a low price to either a relative who is not an immediate family member, or someone outside of the family who is known to the seller.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHDB allows for current flat owners to change the ownership status of their flat due to a change in their family circumstances, such as in the case of divorce, marriage or the demise of the flat\u2019s owner.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo effect the change, they would need to apply for a change in flat ownership that does not constitute a sale, for there is no monetary consideration, HDB\u2019s website states.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn such instances, however, the proposed owners must be an immediate family member of the current owners. This may include their spouse, parents, children or siblings.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of the Tampines flat, selling the unit at a significantly lower price might be a way for the property\u2019s owners to transfer its ownership to a relative who was not an immediate family member.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMr Kelvin Tan, senior associate division director at PropNex Realty, suggested that the low transaction price could have been a result of a resale\u00a0of\u00a0part-share.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese resale transactions involve a change of flat ownership by way of a partial sale or purchase between family members at a mutually agreed price. Monetary consideration is involved for such a change in ownership, HDB states on its website.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch scenarios may involve divorced couples who are joint owners of their matrimonial flat, with one party buying over the share of his or her ex-spouse through a purchase.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResale part-share is not allowed between a married couple.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMr Luqman from 99.co said that another reason for the low transaction price might be that the seller was the flat\u2019s first owner, who bought it from the Government in the mid-1980s.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cThe typical prices for such four-room flats in Tampines was likely in the S$60,000 to S$80,000 range (at the time)\u201d, Mr Luqman said.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch sellers may choose to sell their property at a low price precisely because they had first purchased it cheaply and are able to sell it without incurring much financial loss.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis, coupled with the sale being possibly made to someone close to the seller, may account for why the unit is transacted markedly below the typical market price.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe experts said that the low transaction price may also be seen as a token sum, allowing for a transfer of flat ownership without being an outright gift to the recipient or buyer.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMr Luqman said:\u00a0\u201cAnecdotally for most people, being able to afford their own home through their own effort is a very big milestone and a proud, dignified moment compared to just being handed one.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cTransferring the (unit) to someone close to the person, such as a son or a daughter, through a formal sale could just be a \u2018symbolic transaction\u2019 while not being seen as an outright gift to the receiver.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cIn a way, some dignity is preserved from an act of buying one\u2019s own flat, even though it is marked down significantly.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAsked if incidents such as a death occurring in the apartment previously, unruly neighbours, or nearby religious activities\u00a0would affect a flat\u2019s price, Mr Tan from PropNex Realty said that it is unlikely\u00a0\u2014 although property agents would disclose this information to buyers if asked.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd although buyers may use such information to negotiate for a lower price, Mr Tan said that the price is ultimately decided based on a mutual agreement between buyer and seller, and a seller may reject the low asking price if they are not in great need of the sale.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ESALE WAS AN OUTLIER, UNLIKELY TO AFFECT VALUES NEARBY\u003C\/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe experts said that the prices of other housing units in the area are unlikely to be affected,\u00a0since the HDB resale market does not\u00a0get distorted by a single transaction.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMr Tan of PropNex Realty said that in general, one-off sales are not likely to move the needle, and it takes several such transactions of the same flat type over a period of time to shift valuations.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of just focusing on the low price of the flat, the circumstances behind the sale also matter and it is unlikely\u00a0that future buyers and sellers in the area would encounter a similar scenario.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, a S$100,000 resale\u00a0transaction would be seen as an outlier and is unlikely to be considered by valuers when they valuate\u00a0nearby flats, the experts added.\u003C\/p\u003E",
